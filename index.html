		<p>Throughout my entire life, I have always had a passion in engineering and computer science. Large or small, I can always be found working on some engineering or CS project in my free time. My favorite aspect of engineering is that no matter how much time spent, there is always more to learn. I lose track of time when talking about a completely new tool or innovation that could positively impact a  community. To me, to discover, create, and share a product or application so revolutionary that it forever changes a specified field are simply the most exciting and exhilarating activities one can do.  </p>
		<p>
		Eventually, my experience in computer science and engineering fostered pursuit in entrepreneurship. When I started my first company at sixteen years of age, I developed a love for entrepreneurship. </p>
		<p>
		When Iâ€™m not working mentally, I like to keep myself in shape by mountain biking, rock climbing and backpacking. Other hobbies of mine include reading and scuba diving.

			<text class="moreinfo">About: 
			<p>RedSide Custom Tools is an online store that offers mountain bikers innovative parts, tools, and equipment for bike services and maintenance. We specialize in developing original products that make every mountain bikers' life easier; on the trail and in the workshop. By creating products that target and resolve common problems a mountain biker or bike mechanic will experience, we will achieve our goal of developing the mountain biking tool and equipment industry. We expect to eventually expand to road cycling, backpacking, and other outdoor industries.</p>
			
			<p>Starting around three years ago, my father, sister, and I took up mountain biking. While he is an ex-professional, I quickly became an avid mountain biker. As time went on, I began noticing a severe lack of specific purpose-made tools and equipment for mountain biking. Being experienced in AutoCAD and a 3D printing advocate, I decided to make custom designed tools and equipment to resolve this.</p>
				
			<p>By drawing from my own experiences and from consulting the mountain-biking community, I identify, design, and produce completely new or fundamentally redesigned products to meet these needs. </p>

			<p>Making a professional-quality custom keychain started as a small project to decorate my newly acquired key ring. However, it quickly caught on with my friends and family. Realizing the potential interest many might have in a personalized keychain, I created a set for my local martial arts academy - which was a big hit. After advertising the product at school, it became very popular and developed into a local business.</p>

As an upgrade, I assembled the Prusa I3 MK3 3D printer and utilized it to its full potential. I learned Fusion360 to start making custom prints and useful applications around the house. I later upgraded this to the Multi-Material 2S printer. This 3D printer has been one of the most vital tools for in-house engineering. </p></text>

						<text class="moreinfo"><p>In the summer before attending high school, my best friend and I heavily studied Robotics-based electronics. We had the idea to make a wireless and autonomous robotics car using a Raspberry Pi. However, before we could even begin, there was a massive amount of mechatronics knowledge we needed. We spent hours reading books and watching youtube videos learning how to use Raspberry Pis, breadboards, and complex robotics circuitry.</p></text>

					<text class="date">2018, Age 14</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>A freshmen year CS project.</p>
							<p>Context:<br>
							At my high school, we had what was called One Lunch. The entire school building was open and the student body had 55 minutes to get and eat their lunch whenever. However, lines were long, so the school introduced pre-ordered lunch. If you logged into the school website, and ordered your lunch through a google form before 10 am, you could skip the lunch line and immediately get your food.</p>
							<p>Goal:<br>
							It was extremely easy to forget to pre-order your lunch on busy mornings. To automate this process, my goal was to create an app that would automatically fill out the google form each morning based on order presets.</p>
							<p>Conclusion:<br>
							I never succeeded due to website-login authentication services and a shift of focus to wrestling. However, I took leaps and bounds in growth of my python programming, as well as learning the Selenium python library.</p>

We programmed the Raspberry Pi to direct and automate dc motor movement based on ultrasonic input. We hooked up and attached a phone-style portable battery for self-contained power.

				<text class="eduheaderinfo">Robotics, Electronics</text>
					<text class="date">2018, Age 14</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>While the Autonomous Raspi Car was a great learning experience, it didn't have a purpose. Being a teen that didn't love mowing the lawn, I had the idea to scale the project into a lawn mower. Nothing of the such existed when we started this project - a completely original idea. This included the objective to create a tank-like lawn mower - with tracks - instead of a wheel-based car. While we pursued this, we eventually ran into knowledge and cost barriers. Components capable of regulating power and movement on the scale of a lawn mower were very costly for our age. In addition, the sophisticated knowledge necessary to manage these components far superseded our own. We decided to push this project to a later date. However, within a few months after, main-stream manufacturers began creating and advertising autonomous lawn mowers.</p></text>

					<text class="date">2019, Age 15</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>The 3D Printer Enclosure was a wood and plexi-glass enclosure for the 3D Printer. It served four important functions:</p>
							<ul class="enclosure">
								<li>To trap toxic fumes emitted by the printer.</li>
								<li>To hold in the heat released by the printer for better print quality.</li>
								<li>It enabled the placement of a smoke alarm directly above the printer incase of a worst-case scenario. </li>
								<li>It also enabled the placement of cameras near the printer. I could now visibly check on the printer from a
								nywhere with my phone.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>While these functions were vital and well-addressed by the enclosure, looking cool was a must. This was done with matching colored enclosure components and LEDs. This project required a lot of precise woodworking and custom 3D printed components.</p>

			<text class="eduheader">Automated and Wireless Bedroom Door</text>
				<text class="eduheaderinfo">Electronics, Custom 3D Printing</text>
					<text class="date">2020, Age 15</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>I'm not sure if the motive behind this project was for automation or laziness. However, I wanted to create an application that would open or close my bedroom door with the click of a button from my phone. I did this using a WEMO smart plug, an arduino, a stepper motor, some basic circuitry, and some custom 3D printing components.</p>
						<p>Hardware Setup: <br>
						I 3D printed a mount to the bottom of my door that connected to a fixed high-torque stepper motor that was placed on the floor near the hinges of the door. The arduino was powered via a normal outlet that was always on. The WEMO smart plug was in a different outlet. By plugging an old phone charger cube into the WEMO, I lowered the amp, voltage, and converted the current of the WEMO plug output to a managable input for the arduino. I stripped a USB cable for power and ground which plugged into the old phone cube and directed into the Arduino's input pins.</p>
						<p>Software: <br>
						In C++, I programmed the arduino so that when it recieved power from its input (the WEMO turned on), it would power the fixed stepper motor for a preset amount of time counter-clockwise (opening the door). When the WEMO was turned off and the input would no longer recieve power, the arduino would power the stepper motor clock-wise (closing the door). Using the WEMO app on my phone, I could power and unpower the WEMO plug at the click of a button. This would open or close my door from my phone as planned.
						</p>
						<p>While the novelty of this was cool, it was extremely inconvenient most of the time - considering I had to open my door that way as to not damage the stepper or reverse the direction of the system. In addition to this, the door didn't open completely as the angle of motion/placement of stepper wasn't precise.</p>
						<p>In conclusion, somewhat successful? However, despite taking it down almost immediately, I learned a lot from this project and enjoyed working through it.</p></text>

						<text class="moreinfo"><p>RedSide Custom Tools is the largest project I have ever attempted. It is also the greatest evidence of my tireless pursuit of the exceptional.</p>
						<p>While I had a track record of undertaking continuously more difficult projects, the initiation of a tool company that specializes in original creations was in a different plane of difficulty. What made this so different and exciting was that it channeled every single interest I had into one massive, cohesive goal. However, all the skills that I had accumulated so far were merely the prerequisites to begin.</p>
