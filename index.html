		<p>Throughout my entire life, I have always had a passion in engineering and computer science. Large or small, I can always be found working on some engineering or CS project in my free time. My favorite aspect of engineering is that no matter how much time spent, there is always more to learn. I lose track of time when talking about a completely new tool or innovation that could positively impact a  community. To me, discovering, creating, and developing a product or application that can positively change a community is simply the most exciting and exhilarating activity that I could do.  </p>
		<p>
		Eventually, my experience in computer science and engineering fostered pursuit in entrepreneurship. When I started my first company at sixteen years of age, I developed a love for entrepreneurship. </p>
		<p>
		When I’m not working mentally, I like to keep myself in shape by mountain biking, rock climbing and backpacking. Other hobbies of mine include reading and scuba diving.

			<text class="moreinfo">About: 
			<p>RedSide Custom Tools is an online store that offers mountain bikers innovative parts, tools, and equipment for bike services and maintenance. We specialize in developing original products that make every mountain bikers' life easier; on the trail and in the workshop. By creating products that target and resolve common problems a mountain biker or bike mechanic will experience, we will achieve our goal of developing the mountain biking tool and equipment industry. We expect to eventually expand to road cycling, backpacking, and other outdoor industries.</p>
			
			<p>Starting around three years ago, my father, sister, and I took up mountain biking. While he is an ex-professional, I quickly became an avid mountain biker. As time went on, I began noticing a severe lack of specific purpose-made tools and equipment for mountain biking. Being experienced in AutoCAD and a 3D printing advocate, I decided to make custom designed tools and equipment to resolve this.</p>
				
			<p>By drawing from my own experiences and from consulting the mountain-biking community, I identify, design, and produce completely new or fundamentally redesigned products to meet these needs. </p>
			<p class="PB">Our products have been featured on the world's largest mountain biking news source, PinkBike.

						<text class="moreinfo"><p>An older friend of mine had an XYZ 3D printer. Seeing this sparked my interest in 3D printing. I acquired the parts to build an Anet A8 3D Printer. While this printer was newbishly assembled and worked less than I like to admit, building this 3D printer really opened the door for more future engineering pursuit. I built familiarity with machine assembly, maintenance, and repair early on. In addition to this, I learned about practical 3D printing and slic3r configurations from this project.</p></text>

As an upgrade, I assembled the Prusa I3 MK3 3D printer and utilized it to its full potential. I learned Fusion360 to start making custom prints and useful applications around the house. I later upgraded this to the Multi-Material 2S printer. This 3D printer has been one of the most vital tools for in-house engineering. </p></text>

					<text class="date">2018, Age 14</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>A freshmen year CS project.</p>
							<p>Context:<br>
							At my high school, we had what was called One Lunch. The entire school building was open and the student body had 55 minutes to get and eat their lunch whenever. However, lines were long, so the school introduced pre-ordered lunch. If you logged into the school website, and ordered your lunch through a google form before 10 am, you could skip the lunch line and immediately get your food.</p>
							<p>It was extremely easy to forget to pre-order your lunch on busy mornings. To automate this process, my goal was to create an app that would automatically fill out the google form each morning based on order presets.</p>
							<p>In conlusion, I never succeeded due to website-login authentication services and a shift of focus to wrestling. However, I took leaps and bounds in growth of my python programming, as well as learning the Selenium python library.</p>

We programmed the Raspberry Pi to direct and automate dc motor movement based on ultrasonic input. We hooked up and attached a phone-style portable battery for self-contained power.

				<text class="eduheaderinfo">Robotics, Electronics</text>
					<text class="date">2018, Age 14</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>While the Autonomous Raspi Car was a great learning experience, it didn't have a purpose. Being a teen that didn't love mowing the lawn, I had the idea to scale the project into a lawn mower. Nothing of the such existed when we started this project - a completely original idea. This included the objective to create a tank-like lawn mower - with tracks - instead of a wheel-based car. While we pursued this, we eventually ran into knowledge and cost barriers. Components capable of regulating power and movement on the scale of a lawn mower were very costly for our age. In addition, the sophisticated knowledge necessary to manage these components far superseded our own. We decided to push this project to a later date. However, within a few months after, main-stream manufacturers began creating and advertising autonomous lawn mowers.</p></text>

					<text class="date">2019, Age 15</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>The 3D Printer Enclosure was a wood and plexi-glass enclosure for the 3D Printer. It served four important functions:</p>
							<ul class="enclosure">
								<li>To trap toxic fumes emitted by the printer.</li>
								<li>To hold in the heat released by the printer for better print quality.</li>
								<li>It enabled the placement of a smoke alarm directly above the printer incase of a worst-case scenario. </li>
								<li>It also enabled the placement of cameras near the printer. I could now visibly check on the printer from a
								nywhere with my phone.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>While these functions were vital and well-addressed by the enclosure, looking cool was a must. This was done with matching colored enclosure components and LEDs. This project required a lot of precise woodworking and custom 3D printed components.</p>

			<text class="eduheader">Automated and Wireless Bedroom Door</text>
				<text class="eduheaderinfo">Electronics, Custom 3D Printing</text>
					<text class="date">2020, Age 15</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>I'm not sure if the motive behind this project was for automation or laziness. However, I wanted to create an application that would open or close my bedroom door with the click of a button from my phone. I did this using a WEMO smart plug, an arduino, a stepper motor, some basic circuitry, and some custom 3D printing components.</p>
						<p>Hardware Setup: <br>
						I 3D printed a mount to the bottom of my door that connected to a fixed high-torque stepper motor that was placed on the floor near the hinges of the door. The arduino was powered via a normal outlet that was always on. The WEMO smart plug was in a different outlet. By plugging an old phone charger cube into the WEMO, I lowered the amp, voltage, and converted the current of the WEMO plug output to a managable input for the arduino. I stripped a USB cable for power and ground which plugged into the old phone cube and directed into the Arduino's input pins.</p>
						<p>Software: <br>
						In C++, I programmed the arduino so that when it recieved power from its input (the WEMO turned on), it would power the fixed stepper motor for a preset amount of time counter-clockwise (opening the door). When the WEMO was turned off and the input would no longer recieve power, the arduino would power the stepper motor clock-wise (closing the door). Using the WEMO app on my phone, I could power and unpower the WEMO plug at the click of a button. This would open or close my door from my phone as planned.
						</p>
						<p>While the novelty of this was cool, it was extremely inconvenient most of the time - considering I had to open my door that way as to not damage the stepper or reverse the direction of the system. In addition to this, the door didn't open completely as the angle of motion/placement of stepper wasn't precise.</p>
						<p>In conclusion, somewhat successful? However, despite taking it down almost immediately, I learned a lot from this project and enjoyed working through it.</p></text>

			<text class="eduheader">Voice Automated AutoCAD</text>
				<text class="eduheaderinfo">FusionAPI</text>
					<text class="date">2020, Age 16</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>This was a much bolder and more sophisticated project than most before it. The goal of this project was to utilize google's open-source voice engine and translate basic voice commands to execution of code in Fusion360's API. Put short, it would be Voice-Automated AutoCAD.</p>
						<p>This project was, as usual, way above the level of knowledge that I currently possessed. But I was very excited about the potential this project possessed.</p><p>I wrote this in python. After importing a voice-to-text python library, I had the program search for specific keywords within the voice command and execute some action in Fusion360 followed by given parameters in the voice command. This required a lot of research into Fusion's code and action-scripts. While this worked on a very basic level, I could not find a way to create complex actions. Specifically, I could tell the program to create a sketch. Then I could tell it to make a rectangle that was 35mm by 25mm. I would then tell it to extrude this sketch 50mm outward. I could say other simple actions like fillet the sides X mm. However, compound shapes, that required creating a sketch on a specific side of an extruded shape, or extruding a sketch a certain distance relative to an object was difficult. It was hard to create keywords and parameters for compound actions like these.</p>
						<p>In conclusion, it was a really cool idea and the actions that worked were cool. But it was so limited that it wasn't really usable for anything outside of just the novelty of it. I was quite inexperienced at the time compared to now. Perhaps this project is worth re-visiting and re-vamping.</p>

						<p>While I had a track record of undertaking continuously more difficult projects, the initiation of a tool company that specializes in original creations was in a different plane of difficulty. What made this so different and exciting was that it channeled every single interest I had into one massive, cohesive goal. However, all the skills that I had accumulated so far were merely the prerequisites to begin.</p>
						<p>This company has dragged me through the depths of the void and to the peaks of purpose. Building this company was the first time I have ever dedicated my everything to one objective. Simultaneously, RedSide Custom Tools became my most resented being yet my strongest calling of ambition.</p><p>We make   completely original tools for mountain biking.

			<text class="eduheader">Automated Filament Feeder</text>
				<text class="eduheaderinfo">Custom 3D Printing, Electronics</text>
					<text class="date">2020, Age 16</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>When I was in the transition of hobbyist to professional 3D printing, a lot of changes were needed. The quality and consistency of printing needed a massive leap. One of the particalar problems was the amount of force needed for the printer extruder to pull the filament. Because of the massive amount of pull force needed in the heavily frictioned system, prints were coming out poorly. To overcome this, I wanted to feed the extruder filament, not have the extruder pull in filament. I created an automated mechanism to accomplish this.</p><p>
						A stepper motor with bontech gears attached was used for the grabbing and feeding of the filament. I wired the stepper motor and an ultrasonic sensor to an arduino. The ultrasonic sensor was placed in the filament loading bay and checked whether the filament was slack or taut. The sensor was placed next to the side of the entrance of the filament.</p><p>
						When the filament was slacked and in excess, the sensor would see and register the filament, indicated it was bending. In this case, the stepper would stop, waiting for the printer to use the remaining filament. In the scenario that the sensor saw no filament, it indicated there was no bend, and therefore taut. In this case, the arduino would output to the stepper and begin feeding filament into the printer.</p><p>
						In conclusion, it was a small one-day printer add-on that greatly increased my 3D print quality - and automonously at that.</p></text>

			<text class="eduheader">Created and Sold Day Trading Statistics Calculator</text>
				<text class="eduheaderinfo">Thinkorswim, SQL, Excel</text>
					<text class="date">2020, Age 16</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>In my pursuit of raising money for RedSide, I took up day trading through Thinkorswim. While I was very good at trading, I felt buying and selling just 'whenever it was up' felt random, inconsistent, and improfessional. I wanted a calculator that when given share price and # of shares purchased, it would give me every statistic I could think of to help me. I also wanted a structured method of recording past trades and forming analytics based on past trades. Even though creating the calculator used incredibly basic math, using this calculator was so effective that I doubled my total balance in four weeks.</p><p>
						I started in Microsoft Excel to simplifiy the start. With price per share and number of shares, you could effectively calculate the exact cent you could make on a trade based two main methods. The first method required you to enter the amount of dollars or percent return you wanted to make on a trade. In another section, the excel sheet returned the price per share to satisfy the trade return, the % change in price per share, and the $ change in price per share.</p><p>The second method, still with the two givens of current price per share and # of shares purchased, it would also require an input of a potential future share price. Based on this future share price, the sheet would return the total trade return in $, the $ change in share price, and the % change in share price.</p><p>
						After the standard Buy/Sell section was complete, I recreated this for Short Sale/Buy to Cover. Although the statistics are just mathematical conversions, it did an amazing job at presenting the plausibility of a trade and its return.</p><p>
						This was great for planning trades but saving, recording, and analyzing past trades required the use of a database. Again, I started this created this section in Excel first, using the spreadsheet as a database. The sheet required the ticker symbol, share quantity, purchase date, purchase price, sell price, and sell date. The sheet would return and then fill in sections that showed trade % gain, net profit, time position held, and total investment.</p><p>
						After some data had been entered, the sheet would show the average time a position is held, average gross profit per trade, the average % profit per trade, the average investment amount, the original and current account balance and total gross profit from trades.</p><p>I began working on converting this to a web app using Python and SQL, but after the weekend ended, it became lost in the sea of work for RedSide. I did however sell the clean, professionaly structured excel form of the calculator to two traders at my school.</p></text>

			<text class="eduheader">Built First CNC Router</text>
				<text class="eduheaderinfo">Electronics, Robotics, Fusion CAM</text>
					<text class="date">2020, Age 16</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>Context:<br>I believe that package and product presentation have a high impact on the customer’s perception of product value. In suit with this, I designed and acquired custom product boxes for RedSide's products. Two sources I have drawn inspiration for my packaging from are Toolbox Wars and Abbey Bike Tools. Toolbox Wars, a popular bike-tool Instagram account, has a heavy focus on promoting custom CNC foam inserts for toolboxes. Abbey Bike Tools, a successful mountain bike tool company, utilizes CNC cut foam packaging inserts to create a high-end, luxurious relation to their products. Inspired by this sought-after presentation, I wanted RedSide's products to be displayed in this way to further create a sense of branding and boutique-ness.</p><p>I built my first CNC Router for RedSide. I knew nothing about the software for a cnc machine or how to use one. My first one was built using inexpensive parts and components because I wanted to learn how to custom cnc mill foam before I spent a significant amount of money on it. The machine had a work area of 300mm x 360mm, a 20k rpm motor, no limit sensors, no cooling mechanism, and no vaccuum mechanism. So it was loud, messy, and did a poor job. It was random, inconsistent, and aggravating. But it taught me everything I needed to actually utilize the potential of an expensive milling machine.</p></text>

			<text class="eduheader">Designed and Built Hot-Wire Foam Slicer</text>
				<text class="eduheaderinfo">Woodworking, Circuitry, Custom 3D Printing</text>
					<text class="date">2020, Age 16</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>Context: <br>Before I learned how to cut the edges of an insert with the CNC machine, I did so manually. I typically used an orbital jigsaw to cut the 1.5 inch thick foam. But the edges weren't perfectly straight and the foam cuts weren't always the correct size for custom boxes. Since the actual process of cnc miling foam inserts isn't common, after some research, it seemed a hot-wire foam cutter was the most common method of slicing foam into straight, consistent squares. Being on a low budget, I decided to make a hot-wire foam slicer.</p><p>Using some left over plywood and 2x2s in the garage, I cut, sanded, and assembled a rectangular box with no walls. On the surface of the plywood, a short 2x2 was erected upward, with another short 2x2 above, reaching over the bed. It was like two vectors forming a right-angle if looking from the front. This shape allowed me to add a vertical strip of nichrome wire from the edge of the 2x2 to under the surface plywood. With a series of D batteries, I ran a charge through the thin nichrome wire, heating it dramatically. I added a switch within the circuit to toggle the power. After smoothing the surface, I created a straight and smooth shoulder on the right of the surface to slide the foam against. This would allow a standard cut size with straight slices.</p><p>While it cut the foam smoothly, it burnt the sides and released a lot of toxic fumes from melting the foam.</p><p>In conclusion, it was a good idea and worked pretty well but wasn't suitable for home use. Especially when I finally thought to buy a longer CNC bit and just mill the edges of an insert.</p></text>

			<text class="eduheader">Hosted Secure Public Server on Raspberry Pi</text>
				<text class="eduheaderinfo">Linux, Network Administration, Cybersecurity</text>
					<text class="date">2020, Age 16</text>
						<text class="moreinfo"><p>Context and Goal:<br>The long-term and broad goal of this project was to increase interest in the field of Computer Science of the middle school age within our community through the implementation of javascript in a common video game. Although generally a large field, game design draws from the fields of computer science, cybersecurity, programming, creative writing, graphic design, and engineering design. Even though it usually requires a vast amount of experience and knowledge, game design often invokes some of the most creative aspects of computer science. For a younger generation that loses interest quickly, this was a vital element of our pursuit to interest students in it. Our plan of approach was to design, modify, and create additional software for a video game, in this case, Minecraft.<p>My project partner and I wanted to teach middle school-aged kids how to program in javascript and create minecraft JS plugins. Then, in the backend, we would implement these JS plugins into the minecraft server for them to test and play with.</p> 
						</p><p>Backend Setup: <br>A raspberry pi first needs to be connected to a network before anything else is done. Although the raspberry pi offers wireless WLAN connectivity, we used ethernet because network speed is critical in a smooth, live minecraft server. Once the network was connected, the raspberry pi was given a static IP address. This was a requirement to be able to port forward later on and make the server publicly accessible. After a static IP address was assigned to the raspi, in the private network administration settings, we opened a port - port forwarding - that someone could go through to access the raspi from outside of our local area network (LAN). It was extremely important to make sure this open port was protected or it could have left a massive vulnerability in our home network.</p><p>
						On a separate note, while in the networking settings for the raspberry pi, it was necessary to open port 22; this is the port for Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services to have access to remote command-line and login of another device. We used this because it was a very effective and secure method of accessing, editing, and working inside the Raspberry Pi without having to plug in a monitor, keyboard, and mouse into the raspi every time. Similarly to before, it was important to make sure that the method of accessing the SSH was protected. We used a login, private IP, and randomized 15-character password to secure the open port.</p><p>
						There are two forms of IPs, a local IP and a public IP. While we had a static local IP for our home network, it was important to assign a static public IP that can be used for accessing the Minecraft server and the SSH outside of the home network. This was setup in the networking administration settings with our network provider. 
						</p><p>After most of the networking was done, we downloaded the preset files for a minecraft server from the Mojang.com website. We organized these files and then initiated them on the open port.</p><p>
						As of then, we had a default, vanilla minecraft server that was accessible and editable from anywhere with the proper credentials. It was joinable from any network as long as they were given the IP. This was the public, and secure IP given to anyone who wanted to join the minecraft server. Giving this IP address to players would in no way harm or risk exposing the server or our network. From this point on, the Minecraft server was up and ready to be played, joined, or edited for the addition of javascript plugins.</p><p>
						The focus here was to create a discord server showcasing our server, what we’ve done, what we’re offering, and what we want to do in the future. Attracting new players, coders, and students who are interested in shaping the server and game with their own code was our main goal. However, adding, removing, testing, and creating JS plugins is a complex process that will fully utilize all that we have put together so far and more.
						</p><p>Although we only did this for about two weeks before, as of November 2021, we are revisiting this project in the hopes of scaling to a dozen students or so.</p></text>
